	/// <summary>
	/// Lets any player host a world later ("host swap"). Raft keeps a world only on the PC of the player who hosts it;
	/// to host it another time, the group copies its folder (Raft's World\&lt;name&gt;) to the next host's PC. The mod's own
	/// state of the world (Mods\DynamicIslands\worlds\&lt;world id&gt;.txt: custom islands, what was used, quests, the
	/// journal, levels, world rules, randomizer, options...) lives beside it on the host's PC, so it would stay behind.
	/// Two copies make it travel:
	///  - the host writes the world file into Raft's world folder too (CustomIslands.txt), so it moves with the folder;
	///  - the host sends it to every player each time Raft saves (and to a player who joins), and they keep it as their
	///    own worlds\&lt;world id&gt;.txt, so the world can be hosted by any of them with its latest state.
	/// When a world loads, the newest of the copies (by the "@savecount" counter in it) is read. Island files come along with
	/// joining already (a player keeps them as &lt;name&gt;_&lt;hash&gt;.island); the list says each island's hash, so a new host
	/// finds its copy and the island keeps its name (rules, quests, journal pages refer to it).
	///
	/// Older saves: Raft keeps the last 8 saves of a world (World\&lt;name&gt;\&lt;date&gt;, the newest "-Latest"), and its
	/// Load Game box can load any of them. So that the mod's state goes back with Raft's (a chest looted after that save
	/// is full again, a quest is where it was), the copy is also written into the save's own folder with Raft's stamp of
	/// that save ("@raftsave=", RGD_Game.lastPlayedDateTicks); loading a save reads the copy with the same stamp.
	///
	/// Writes between Raft's saves (a story step, a Receiver unlock, a setting changed) say so ("@between=" the stamp of
	/// Raft's save they follow, instead of "@raftsave="). After a crash or Alt+F4 such a copy is newer than Raft's save
	/// (the players' inventories): loading that save then takes the islands' state - chests, quests, story - from the
	/// copy written with it, and only the settings (SettingKeys) from the newer copy, so no loot or reward is lost - AU3.
	/// "Newest" goes by the world's save counter ("@savecount=", one more on every write, carried in every copy and sent
	/// with it), the PC's clock ("@savedat=") only breaks a tie: two PCs' clocks needn't agree - AU4.
