	/// On top of Raft's game mode (Easy / Normal / Hard) and of the health and damage an island's builder gave its animals.
	/// Left as Raft has them (the user's choice): puffer fish damage (explosion, cloud, poison) and everything about Bruce
	/// and the raft (his bites on its blocks, how often he comes for it, how soon a killed shark comes back).
	/// Saved per world ("@monsters=savage" in the world file) and sent to every player who joins, with the build cost
