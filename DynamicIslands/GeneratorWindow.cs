	///                        animals and loot boxes; saved presets of one's own.
	///   Randomize existing - one of Raft's islands (with its picture): "something new like it" fills the settings in
	///                        from its measurements, "a variation of it" starts from its own ground and changes its shape.
	///   Ready-made         - the map types: whole islands with content and a story, made as a new island file.
	/// Every setting has a "?" to hover for help. Generate replaces the current island (one Ctrl+Z brings the old one
	/// back). Built in code with UIKit. Opened from the top bar's Generate button and the Island tab.
